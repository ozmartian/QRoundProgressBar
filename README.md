This is a port of QRoundProgressBar (https://sourceforge.net/projects/qroundprogressbar) to Python 3 PyQt6.

#### A Simple Example

Install via PyPi:

```
sudo pip install qroundprogressbar
```

Install via Git clone:

```
git clone git@github.com:ozmartian/QRoundProgressBar.git
cd QRoundProgressBar
sudo pip install .
```

Run TestWidget.py to see a more detailed example of the module at work.

I've also included the original C++ project's documentation in the docs folder which you should easily be
able to follow and apply to PyQt6 as per usual.
